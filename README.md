# Crop-Analysis-India
### _(Part of Spotle AI - NASSCOM Community AI Internship Program)_ 
The dataset contains information on crop covered area (Hectare) and production (Tonnes) for 122 different crops in 33 states of India across 14 years (2000-2013).
- To study and analyse crop production, production contribution to State/country, performance, and high yield production order for crops, crop growing pattern and diversification
- To forecast the product of the crop for future periods, which can be used to formulate crop-related schemes.
- Average production of the crops in India.
- Crop with maximum yield (Tonnes / Hectare)
- Comparative study on Rice production between Odisha and West Bengal.
- State with the highest production of Wheat
- Model to predict the production of Rice in 2014 for Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
